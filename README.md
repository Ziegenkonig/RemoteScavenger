# RemoteScavenger

Game being worked on in Java with the libGDX library. Takes place in a remote starship graveyard
left over from a massive battle, where the player character has been living and attempting to make it big as a scavenger.
The player does not scavenge themselves, they build robotic scavengers of all shapes and sizes to explore and do
the hard work for them.

Most of the good stuff is in RemoteScavenger/core/src; all the current art is in RemoteScavenger/core/assets

Things that are done right now:
 - 'Main Menu' screen
 - 'Workshop' screen
    - Still need to refine some of the items in this screen, but a lot of functionality is there
 - Art/animation for the workshop screen as well as two dummy player characters, as well as the items inside the workshop screen
 - Art/animation for many component items that go into the crafting of a droid
 
 Things that are not done and at high priority:
 - Mechanics need to be programmed for the crafting minigames
 - Tons of art/animation needs to be done for said minigames
 - Decide on a base resource system vs a base component system (ie find base resources while scavenging or prebuilt components)
 - Setup at least a rough draft of the combat mechanics
 - Decide whether or not the outside world is procedurally generated
 - Make a list of droids that need to be drawn/programmed
